# Agent Logging Protocol

## When
- After a **Cursor Agent** task completes (Plan→Implement→Verify 종료 직후).
- When the user asks to "**log this conversation so far**".

## Where
- Directory: `.cursor/logs/YYYY-MM/auto/`
- Filename: `ai-conversation-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If file exists, **append** a new entry separated by `---`.

## What (sections)
1. Summary (one-liner)
2. Problem Analysis (complexity/priority/scope/est. time)
3. Solution (approach, libs, code changes, steps)
4. Result (achieved, metrics)
5. Learnings (tips, refs)
6. Next Steps (todos, risks)
7. Tags/Priority

## Style
- Korean, concise, markdown, emojis for sections.
- Small code blocks only when essential.
