# Stage Gates
- Default stage: **PLAN**.
- The agent MUST NOT create/modify files unless the user writes:
  `PROCEED: IMPLEMENT`.
- Each stage outputs a short summary and waits for explicit consent.

# Allowed per stage
- PLAN: components/state/api outline **only** (markdown). No file edits.
- DESIGN: interfaces, selectors, SCSS structure **as markdown**. No file edits.
- IMPLEMENT: file creation limited to allowlist; commit small, atomic changes; then run typecheck/lint/test.
